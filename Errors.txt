1. Question 1.5 have a grammar mistake. I tried it on my Windows computer and clang says there might be a bug and for some reasons gcc has failed doing ANYTHING.

2. If this book is for beginners, please just mention DO NOT USE gets. The very safe way is just use std::string in C++ to avoid memory overflow.

3. Mention (expr)?case1:case2 will not work if case1 and case2 have not a same return type. 

4. Show how to use gdb.

5.  Mention we need to check recursive functions for every 'if's in the parameters so it will not crash or infinite loop.
